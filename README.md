## Installation

**Step 1:** Add the following yaml file as build.yml in .github/workflows folder of your app repository.

**Note:** _If your project uses any services of firebase, please refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/DarthBenro008/app-brickie/wiki) for instructions. The below instructions are only for **vanilla builds.**_


#### **For Native Android Builds (Java/Kotlin) :**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: App Brickie
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: AppBrickie
        id: appBrickieBuild
        uses: DarthBenro008/app-brickie@v2.0
        with:
          type: "native"
          chatid: "Your Unique ID Goes here"
          packagename: "Your App Name Goes Here"
      - name: Get Automated Result
        run: echo "${{ steps.appBrickieBuild.outputs.result }}"
```

#### **For Flutter Builds:**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: App Brickie
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: AppBrickie
        id: appBrickieBuild
        uses: DarthBenro008/app-brickie@v2.0
        with:
          type: "flutter"
          abi: "YOUR TARGET API" #Defaults to FAT APK
          chatid: "Your Unique ID Goes here"
          packagename: "Your App Name Goes Here"
      - name: Get Automated Result
        run: echo "${{ steps.appBrickieBuild.outputs.result }}"
```

#### **Checkout the [WIKI](https://github.com/DarthBenro008/app-brickie/wiki) Page for more detailed instructions!**

<br>

**Step 2 :** Go To [@AppBrickieBot](https://t.me/appbrickiebot) on Telegram to generate your unique id.

**Step 3:** Replace your UniqueID from the bot in the YAML File above besides chatid **in quotes**
for eg:

```yaml
chatid: "qwerty12345"
```

**For Flutter Builds :**

Specify the abi type you want to build, if you dont specify any by default it will build Fat APK.

|   ABI Type  |            Code           |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------:|
| armeabi-v7a | ``` abi: "armabi-v7a" ``` |
| arm64-v8a   | ``` abi: "arm64-v8a" ```  |
| x86_64      | ``` abi: "x86_64" ```     |
|   Default   |          FAT APK          | 

<br>

#### **Optional Settings :** 
You can rename the app file name, by default its set to app-debug.apk, but to change that, add an input of packagename: "< YOUR APP NAME >"

Eg: 
```yaml
packagename: "myapp"
```

**Step 4:** Sit back and enjoy :D, get your build delivered to you on telegram automatically when a pull request or commit is created on master branch!
